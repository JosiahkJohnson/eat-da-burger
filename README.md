Click on the "eat-da-burger" button to move the burger to the right side of the screen, the button will then say "make another" to move it back to the left. You can create another burger at the bottom in the small form section by inserting a name and choosing if it's eaten already or not. Each burger has their own remove button to remove them from the database all together.
